# PhotoBucketGrabber
Download all your photos from PhotoBucket using this Python script.

## Requirements
Python 3.4+, I think? Just use the latest Python 3 version.

## Instructions
1. Log in to your Photobucket account.
2. Go to your "Library".
3. Click the checkbox on any photo.
4. Click "Select all" at the top of your bucket. This should add those photos to a black bar at the bottom.
5. Navigate to each of your albums and click "Select all" to add them to the total selection.
6. Once you have selected all the photos you want to download, click "Link" on the bottom bar.
7. Copy the "Direct" link box.
8. Paste those links into a file called "photo.txt" in the same directory as the Python script. Save that file.
9. Run `grab.py`.
10. Watch your photos get downloaded.
11. Feel free to delete your Photobucket account if the photos aren't linked anywhere live anymore.
